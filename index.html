      <p>My name is William Amato and I am currently going through the UCF Coding Bootcamp to further my education and to advance in the field of technology. I plan on becoming the best developer I can be.</p>

      <p>I have a first degree blackbelt in Taekwondo (I would have a second degree, but I had to go to a gymnastics competition the same day as my testing, so basically I'm a second degree), I was a gymnast, and I'm a dancer.</p>

      <p>I have completed an associates degree at Valencia and I am currently employed as a deep water guard at Aquatica, Seaworld's water park. I have over one hundred hours volunteering for Celebration Hospital working in the supply chain as well as helping in the fitness center. My current area of focus is coding and learning to become a full stack web developer.</p>
